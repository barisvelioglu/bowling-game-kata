# Bowling Game Kata
[Uncle Bob's Bowling game Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) in python.
Though most of the Kata is identical to it's Java counterpart, there is some code which is written in way to be as 'pythonic' as possible. 
There are some refactoring steps which are different as well.



Check the code out and run 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # installs py.test for running the tests
py.test test_bowling_game.py # Runs the tests
```

Uncle Bob's original powerpoint is [also checked in](https://github.com/Aplopio/bowling-game-kata/blob/master/bowling_game_kata.ppt).

Each commit (other than the first few ones) have slide numbers in the commit messages that correspond to ones in the powerpoint.
Each commit corresponds to a step in the Kata (either a changed test/code or a refactor). The idea is to follow the exact same steps as the commits.
